# OmegaPedFortress
This is a simple standalone script for FiveM, It spawns a small army around an area and you have to kill them to get into the area. This is intended to be used with other scripts, for example, the one I had in mind was to have an arms dealer on the aircraft carrier so anytime you wanted to buy illegal weapons you would have to take out a small army of guards to gain access to the arms dealer.

To confige the peds health pools, accuracy, armour, ammo and Combat movement just edit the config.lua
